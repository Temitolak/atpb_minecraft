## Ansible Tower Minecraft Server Play Books
##### Project Status: 3UPA (Uber Unstable & Ultra Pre-Alpha)
##### My goal is to use a combination of Ansible Tower, GitHub, and an Ubuntu 14.04 snapshot to teach myself how to:
  - Control Ansible Tower
  - Write YAML syntax
  - Write Ansible Plays
  - Create a fully functional Minecraft Server using only DevOps processes
  - Improve my ability to control Git & GitHub
  - Continue to practice Linux system admin skills

It is likely that this repository will be riddled with errors for the near future. However, I certainly welcome the input and assistance of others to improve the overall best-practices and functionality.
